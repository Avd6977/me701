To solve this problem, I used a similar method to the optimize.py example we had in class. I loaded in the text file provided with three columns, Z (atomic number), A (mass number), and B (given values of the function). Using A and Z, I calculated an estimated value for B (B_til), with an inital guess of the coefficients. Using the scipy.otpimize.minimize function, I minimized the root mean square of the differences between B and B_til. The output of the minimize function includes the coefficients that provide the minimized RMS.
